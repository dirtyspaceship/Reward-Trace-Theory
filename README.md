ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE USE DISCLOSURE:

All works in this repository have been created with the assistance of multiple large language models. AI was used for:

- Ideological stress testing (e.g., probing for biases or edge cases)
- Proposal refinement (e.g., improving structure, clarity, or phrasing)
- Direct iteration (e.g., generating drafts or alternatives)

The final content has been reviewed, edited, and approved by the human maintainer. However, AI-generated outputs can contain errors, hallucinations, biases, or outdated information.

Use this repository at your own risk. Contributions, issues, and feedback are encouraged to help improve accuracy and quality!
