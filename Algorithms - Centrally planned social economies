Algorithms Are the New Central Planners: How Reward Trace Theory Exposes the Socialist Calculation Problem in Your Feed
Subtitle Reward Trace Theory shows why voluntary social bonds collapse under algorithmic coercion—and why the loneliness epidemic is the inevitable result of treating attention like a planned economy.
Body
Reward Trace Theory (RTT) reveals that all sustained human social behavior—love, hatred, devotion, vendettas, martyrdom—is the subpersonal optimizer relentlessly pushing receiver-specific valuations as far from affective indifference as finite reorganization capacity allows. Trace distance is signed: positive (proximity-seeking, investment) or negative (aversion, retaliation). The optimizer is sign-neutral; it allocates toward whatever mechanism delivers superior weighted distance through direct reinforcement.
Positive dominance isn’t morality. It’s physics. Proximity-seeking mechanisms are voluntary exchange: mutual trace gains, low resistance, scalable cooperation. Coercive mechanisms force distance through cost, resistance, instability—zero- or negative-sum traps that demand constant reinvestment and eventually collapse.
This is straight Mises and Hayek, applied to the limbic layer.
Subjective value = trace distance Scarcity = finite identity-level reorganization capacity Marginal utility = diminishing incremental trace from each additional mechanism Diminishing returns = the law that new mechanisms serve ever-less-urgent valuations
The subpersonal optimizer faces a Hayekian knowledge problem: trace valuations are dispersed, tacit, contextual, private. No conscious “planner” (your inner narrator) can aggregate them. Behavioral reallocation—approach or avoidance—is the decentralized price signal. Narratives are post-hoc propaganda.
Game theory enters here: every trace portfolio is a repeated, incomplete-information game with multiple receivers. Nash equilibria emerge as stable allocations; cooperative games (proximity-seeking) allow mutual gains; non-cooperative games (aversionary/coercive) breed conflict and resistance.
Voluntary mechanisms win long-run because they’re positive-sum: they expand the total trace pie with lower friction. Coercive mechanisms shrink it, provoke pushback, and require escalating force to survive—exactly as Mises (1920) showed central planning fails and Rothbard (1970) framed intervention as theft-plus-deadweight loss.
Enter the modern coercive distortion: algorithmic attention platforms.
These are literal central planners of social valuation. They aggregate noisy proxies (likes, swipes, dwell time) into feeds, pretending to know dispersed limbic states they cannot access. Phantom metrics become falsified prices: centrally observable signals divorced from real reallocation feedback.
Cantillon effects are immediate and brutal. Early/lucky viral accounts capture attention rents before the inflation is priced in. Late entrants face depleted markets. Power-law distribution (top 1% hoards engagement) inverts positive dominance: cheap aversionary virality (rage-bait, outrage porn) outcompetes cooperative proximity-seeking.
The result is fitness collapse. Fitness here means capacity to identify behaviors that cause observable reallocation (proximity reinforces, aversion strategically exploits). Algorithms provide zero meaningful reallocation feedback—indefinite persistence without developmental consequence. The optimizer starves: baseline trace distance drops to near-zero, nuclear concentration spikes, opportunity costs vanish. Coercive/self-destructive mechanisms (drugs, doomer spirals, ideological extremism) become locally rational because nothing else competes.
Isolation becomes the coercive equilibrium. Structure dominates traits: the same person with diversified proximity-seeking mechanisms exhibits stable cooperation; in algorithmic starvation, that person rationally shifts to aversionary desperation. Portfolio brittleness produces U-shaped volatility: shallow indifference flips signs easily, moderate equilibria are stable, nuclear tails explode under perturbation.
Population-level consequence: behavioral unpredictability at scale. Rapid mechanism-switching, extremism cascades, foreclosure events (loneliness → radicalization → violence) occur at frequencies that break every policy model built for diversified 1970s portfolios. Governments and institutions misforecast responses because they operate on obsolete behavioral assumptions—no trace-delivery signals, no discovery procedure, pure calculation failure.
This is the socialist calculation problem, reborn in dopamine circuits.
The escape is the same as always: restore voluntary reallocation feedback. Dismantle centralized feed curation. Let trace competition discover equilibria through revealed preference, not engagement-optimized distortion.
Until then, the feed is the new Gosplan—and we’re all living in the resulting shortage.
